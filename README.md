# redcross: Reduction and Cross-correlation of High-Resolution spectroscopy for exoplanet atmospheres

This repository contains a set of utilities to work with high-resolution order-by-order spectra, in particular
- Read and visualise time-series spectroscopy 
- Reduce data: normalise, remove continuum, systematics, tellurics and prepare for cross-correlation
- Cross-correlation: Compute the CCF function for a given atmospheric template
