redcross documentation
=========================================

Welcome to the **redcross** documentation. This open-source python package is build for **red**\ uction and **cross**\-correlation of high-resolution spectra for exoplanet atmospheres. It provides a flexible and fast object-oriented framework to *test reduction routines*, manipulate order-separated spectra and *compute cross-correlation functions (CCFs)*. In addition, it is a useful guide to understand and visualise every step of the reduction process directly on the 2D-datacubes.


**In the `"Tutorial" <content/tutorial.html>`_ section one can find how to get started with some examples with HARPS-N and GIANO data.**

*redcross* has been used to find atomic and molecular species in optical wavelengths (Fe in WASP-189b with HARPS-N) and in the infra-red (CO in WASP-189b and WASP-33b with GIANO)
